<h1>The Queen of My Heart</h1>
<p>I’ll be the warrior to fight for our love;<br>
    We’ll fly together, fly higher that the dove.<br>
    I’ll be your wall and shield you from danger;<br>
    I’ll take all the pains, for to me they are no stranger.<br>
    <br>
    You’ll be the queen in the kingdom of my heart;<br>
    And then I’ll be the king, so we’ll never be apart.<br>
    You’ll be my majesty— I will serve you forever;<br>
    And for all of times, I will leave you never</p>
